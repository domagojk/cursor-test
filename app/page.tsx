              <p>
                Our company regularly hosts hackathons to foster innovation,
                collaboration, and creativity among our teams. These events
                provide a platform for employees to explore new technologies,
                develop prototypes, and showcase their skills.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each hackathon has a unique theme and challenges that align with
                our company&apos;s goals and vision for the future. Participants
                form cross-functional teams and work intensively over a period
                of 24-48 hours to develop their projects.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many of the projects featured in this archive have gone on to
                become integral parts of our product ecosystem or have inspired
                new features and capabilities in our existing products.
